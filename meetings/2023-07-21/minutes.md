## Agenda

### Open Discussion - New Initiatives:
* The group discussed opportunities to connect to the community. Katie would like to connect with educators and offer a forum to share demos and learning/training tools. She also wants the committee to help connect learners to open source projects, but more work needs to be done to not overwhelm either side. Lastly, Katie shared information about [Developer Roadmaps](https://roadmap.sh/), a popular GitHub project that displays various paths throughout the industry. This could be a good resource for early-career developers and others wanting to learn more about .NET. Kevin recommended researching Laravel as an entry into the .NET developing community.


**The meeting adjourned at 12:24PM EDT.**
