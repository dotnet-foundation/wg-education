# Agenda #

* **Proposal for Education pages on Foundation website**
    * Katie Savage walked through the proposal for an update to the Education section of the Foundation website, including adding pages for educational content and the sponsorship initiative. 
    * The committee discussed whether the content page would have a list of the vetted partners or if each partner would have their own page. It was agreed that at this time, a single page of content appropriately labeled to guide learners would be the best model. 
    * The committee also discussed the budget for sponsorship, though this is still under review with the Board. Frank Odoom presented this proposal at the April Board meeting to raise awareness and support.

* **Education content workstream**
    * The committee discussed how to best store the education content on the Foundation website. Katie suggested following the "Speaker Directory" template, but concners were raised that the filter only works if the content is accurately tagged, which is a time-consuming process. 
    * Mike Woodring suggested tagging the content based on accessibility and features rather than the specific technology addressed in the content. 
    * Aneesh Ambivakally added that there needs to be a way to track which content the students use to better facilitate trainings.

* **Bootcamp / Education platforms and sponsorship**
    * The committee discussed how to best utilize funding for students. There were concerns about the budget as some courses and bootcamps are very expensive. Katie shared that she and Frank are looking globally for options that are cost effective. 
    * Frank added that maybe for the first run of the initiative, the committee partners with an organization that offers an accessible beginner course rather than a lengthy bootcamp. 
    * The committee also discussed how to measure success of the initiative. In the best case scenario, the course would grant a certificate of completion, or require a passing grade on a knowledge test. However, some courses don't offer either option. 
    * Katie added that perhaps the best measure of success is if the student completed the course and got a job. 
    * Mike suggested that courses on soft skills, interviewing, building resumes, etc be added to the list.

* **All Other Business**
    * The Discord channel was created and Nicole Miller will include the invite in the next newsletter.
